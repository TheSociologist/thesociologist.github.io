A list of books I've read or am reading. I'm hoping this forces me to actually make some progress.

# Reading
- [**Get Together**](https://www.amazon.com/Get-Together-build-community-people/dp/1732265194) by Bailey Richardson, Kevin Huynh, and Kai Elmer Sotto: about building community. Super early on this one so not much to report. 
- [**Leviathan Wakes**](https://www.amazon.com/Leviathan-Wakes-Expanse-Book-1-ebook/dp/B0047Y171G/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1638914452&sr=1-1): Like halfway through this. Picked it up cause of the show and the GRRM quote on the cover. Liking it so far, especially the emphasis on hard science fiction. 

# Read
- [**Jarhead**](https://www.amazon.com/Jarhead-Marines-Chronicle-Other-Battles/dp/0743244915) by Anthony Swofford: picked this up after watching the movie by Sam Mendes. This was very good if, as expected, super depressing. I'd group this with Generation Kill (both the book and the show) which you should also check out.
- [**UX For Lean Startups**](https://www.amazon.com/UX-Lean-Startups-Experience-Research-ebook/dp/B07LGGNWJC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=JYMBFNGCXD12&keywords=lean+ux&qid=1638914529&s=digital-text&sprefix=Lean+UX%2Cdigital-text%2C147&sr=1-3) by Laura Klein: Finally a super practical book on UX. I've read into Ries' [Lean Startup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup) methodology and this seems like the perfect companion piece. Which makes sense since Klein and him work together. 
- [**The Good War**](https://www.amazon.com/Good-War-Oral-History-World-ebook/dp/B005LXC99G/ref=sr_1_2?keywords=The+Good+War&qid=1638915581&s=digital-text&sr=1-2) by Studs Turkel: There's some incredible stories from WWII here, captured word for word from the people who lived through it.  Picked this up after reading an interview from Brooks about it (World War Z uses a similar tagline). Only read half of this, but I'm planning on going back.
- [**World War Z**](https://www.amazon.com/World-War-Oral-History-Zombie-ebook/dp/B000JMKQX0/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=World+War+Z&qid=1638915013&s=digital-text&sr=1-3) by Max Brooks: This book is very good and very different from the movie. Sublime structure and satire. 
- [**Neuromancer**](https://www.amazon.com/Neuromancer-Sprawl-Trilogy-William-Gibson-ebook/dp/B000O76ON6/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1KQEQ0U1DGP0E&keywords=neuromancer+william+gibson&qid=1638915563&s=digital-text&sprefix=Neuromancer%2Cdigital-text%2C156&sr=1-1) by William Gibson: The cyberpunk classic. And for a reason. While I found myself getting occasionally frustrated with the jargon, its very easy to see why some of my favorite IP took note. Maybe I'll check out the rest of the Sprawl trilogy someday. 

# Gave up
- [**Infinite Jest**](https://www.amazon.com/Infinite-Jest-David-Foster-Wallace-ebook/dp/B000S1M9LY/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=infinite+jest&qid=1638914789&s=digital-text&sr=1-1) by David Foster Wallace: I once emailed one my English professor to ask why run-on sentences were okay in Wallace's writing but not in mine. I never heard back. I guess you gotta know the rules to break them or something like that. Either way, I dislike this book immensely. His [commencement speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CrOL-ydFMI) is pretty good, though.
